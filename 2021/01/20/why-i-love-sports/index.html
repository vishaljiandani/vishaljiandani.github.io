                    <p>My mother hates when I do.</p>

<p>Soccer. The most watched sport around the world (although not the most entertaining). One has to wonder why a sport which has only a handful of impactful highlights per game can be so popular the world over. The FIFA World Cup is the most watched sporting event every time it is broadcast, constantly breaking records that were set the previous time.</p>

<p>There’s a reason for this: it’s bloody fun to play. Maybe kicking an object with all the force you can muster without any consequences (except maybe breaking your neighbors window) is just too enticing to resist. For me personally though, it’s the perfect distraction. And right now, we all desperately need distractions.</p>

<p>I talk about soccer, but this sentiment extends to every sport out there (maybe even just exercising too). Ask any soccer player how they feel when they score a goal, and 9/10 of them will say something along the lines of pure joy. It’s one of those moments where you feel like nothing can stop you, and you can conquer anything life throws at you.</p>

<p>Now I know what you’re thinking - “I could just workout”. And while that does have it’s own merits, it just isn’t the same thing. This is the reason why people (including me) find it so difficult to get themselves to exercise. It just isn’t as good of a distraction. Before a soccer game, I’m putting my phone away and not looking at it for the next 1+ hours. But at the gym, I’m constantly looking for a new song. Besides, the endorphin hit after a good game of soccer (or any sport) is unlike any other.</p>

<p>Sport does have its drawbacks though. You aren’t going to build muscle as quickly as you like just playing sports. Weight training is necessary to build the body that can actually play the sport well (and of course, look good). And who doesn’t want to look good?</p>
