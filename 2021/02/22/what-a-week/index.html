                    <p>It’s been over a month since my last post.</p>

<p>It’s been partly down to my own laziness and partly down to the fact that things have been quite hectic. However, now that things have settled, it’s time for me to walk you through the events of the previous week.</p>

<p>Sunday didn’t start off great. The weather in DFW (Dallas Fort Worth) had been consistently worsening with each passing day, with a snowstorm forecasted for that day. Unlucky for me, I had a shift for my on campus job that evening, and sure enough, had to walk home in the snowstorm. Having experienced a full blown snowstorm for the first time, I’m praying that I’ll never have to move to Canada.</p>

<p>Fast forward to the early hours of Tuesday, when Texas’ electric grid predictably gives out due to the arctic like temperatures (It hit -20 degree Celsius at one point). I wake up at 4am because the house is completely silent, and I’m a light sleeper without my table fan. Sigh. No sleep for the rest of the morning then.</p>

<p>We proceed to not have power for the next two days, with the exception of one hour bouts of electricity per day. But man, did we need it. The temperature in the house had reached a dangerous low of 8 degree Celsius, which is way worse than it sounds. Having to be fully dressed at home all the time is not a great feeling.</p>

<p>But that didn’t matter anymore, because Wednesday was the day I got my first internship offer in the United States. I’m not going to lie, it was a VERY good feeling. The company is called Health Catalyst, and it’s a healthcare analytics provider based out of Salt Lake City.</p>

<p>It was a bit surreal. I had been feeling down the previous week over the fact that another company that I had interviewed with had virtually ghosted me, despite the fact that the interview went well and they had indicated that they wanted to move on to next steps. I only found out that they had given it to someone else because someone in my LinkedIn network had posted about getting it.</p>

<p>Looking back on it now, I’m so grateful that I didn’t get it. I would have probably taken that offer because I still had the final technical interview with Health Catalyst to go, and I wasn’t willing to risk losing an offer for an interview that I could so easily screw up. I ended up getting a role that’s more interesting, better paid and at a company where the interviewers actually turn their cameras on (Yes, that actually happened at the other company). To quote my favorite Green Day song, good riddance.</p>

<p>Thankfully, we got our electricity back, only for our water to give out. I honestly wasn’t bothered with it. I was still celebrating. It did come back after two days, just like the power. We were lucky though. As of writing this article, there are STILL people in my apartment complex with no water. The week ended with an absolutely delectable meal of Red Lobster’s shrimp and biscuits on Saturday night, which I highly recommend trying if you haven’t already.</p>

<p>It was certainly one hell of a week, so much so that I felt compelled to write about it. I did come out it having learned more about myself than I did in the preceding year, and for that I’m eternally grateful.</p>
