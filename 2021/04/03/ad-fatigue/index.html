                    <p>We’ve all been there.</p>

<p>I made the horrible mistake of googling the term ‘sunglasses’ as I was on the lookout for a pair. You can imagine what happened next. Cue the advertisement bombardment from Facebook, Instagram and YouTube.</p>

<p>I always used to think of myself as someone who doesn’t really get bothered by the ads (thank you skip button). I actually like some of them as I have a real appreciation for their creativity (shoutout to the Geico lizard). But I think I’ve officially reached a tipping point.</p>

<p>I can’t even remember the last time I saw an ad for something other than a pair of sunglasses. Companies and websites that I haven’t even heard of wanting to sell me a pair (some even think I want prescription sunglassess??). I’m still getting the ads as I write this, TWO WEEKS after buying a good pair. If the big tech companies are so good at collecting data on me, surely they know that I’ve bought one already?</p>

<p>This isn’t even the first time this is happening. A few months ago I went through something similar. I was researching a company that I had an interview lined up with, and of course, I googled them. It’s a human resources firm that shall remain nameless. The day after that, all my YouTube ads seemed concerned about my staffing needs, with this company featuring prominently. Surely the folks at Google know that I don’t really own a business to require staffing?</p>

<p>I’ve now instructed Firefox to delete all cookies every time I close the browser. It has meant that I have to keep logging into websites instead of the convenience of not having to type my password in over and over, but hey, at least I’m a “smart consumer” now.</p>
