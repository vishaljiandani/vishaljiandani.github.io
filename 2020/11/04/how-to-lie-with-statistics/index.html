                    <p>I want to start off by saying that this book is only a meagre 140 pages, with a lot of illustrations (some really cute ones too). But it drives home it’s title better than any other book I’ve read.</p>

<p>The book tells you about all the various sources of bias and error that creep into statistical calculations. About how measures of central tendency (mean, median and mode), are manipulated so often just to sell something. About how the absence of a an accompanying figure (like a confidence level) is usually intentional, but including it is just as important as the value itself.</p>

<p>It packs a great deal into those 140 pages, so much so that you get the feeling that every paragraph has something new in it for you to learn, unlike a lot of other books, which tend to say the same thing over and over with an array of phrasings. And don’t underestimate the vocabulary either. I found myself looking up the meaning of words ever so often, but not so much that it sucked the enjoyment out of reading it.</p>

<p>All in all, it’s a book that I highly recommend, even to those “non-technical” folk out there who feel they have nothing to gain from it. The book is written keeping these people in mind. It’s also a great way to equip yourself for the “disinformation age”. Fake news and fake statistics are everywhere now, and one must be able to distinguish between the truth and exaggeration. I’m going to end with my favorite quote from the book:</p>

<p>“The crooks already know these tricks; honest men must learn them in self-defense.”</p>
